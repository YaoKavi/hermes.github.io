      <h2>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h2>
      <p>Learn about the phases and processes involved in software development.</p>
      <p> 
        The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) provides a structured framework for creating high-quality software. This established methodology outlines the key stages involved:
      <ul>
        <li>Requirement Gathering: Clearly define the purpose, functionalities, and target audience of your software.</li>
        <li>Planning and Design: Develop a comprehensive project plan and user interface (UI) / user experience (UX) design that aligns with project goals.</li>
        <li>Development: Write code, build features, and integrate software components according to the plan.</li>
        <li>Testing and Quality Assurance: Rigorously test all aspects of the software to ensure optimal performance and identify and rectify any potential issues.</li>
        <li>Deployment and Maintenance: Launch your software and provide ongoing support to users, addressing emerging issues and implementing improvements.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
<p>By adhering to a structured SDLC, you can ensure your software development process is efficient, organized, and delivers the desired outcome within a predictable timeframe.</p>
