      <h2>Basics</h2>
      <p>Discover the fundamental concepts of web design and development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>
        Web design and development, though distinct disciplines, work in harmonious unison to create a website. Here's a closer look at their specialized roles:
      <ul>
        <li>
            Web Design: Focuses on the aesthetic appeal and user experience (UX) of a website. 
            Web designers prioritize visual elements, layout, information architecture, and user interaction to create an engaging and intuitive online environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Web Development: Transforms the designer's vision into a functional website. 
            Web developers translate design mockups and user interfaces (UI) into code, ensuring the website operates seamlessly across various devices and browsers.

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
      <p>Learn frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and explore frameworks like React and Angular.</p>
      <p>
        The front-end, also known as the client-side, represents the portion of a website users directly interact with. Here's a breakdown of the key technologies that bring the front-end to life:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Forms the foundation of a web page, defining its structure and content layout.</li>
        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Dictates the visual presentation of a web page, controlling elements like layout, typography, and color schemes.</li>
        <li>JavaScript: Adds interactivity to web pages, enabling features like animations, dynamic content updates, and user input validation.</li>
        <li>Front-End Frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js): Provide pre-written code structures and tools to streamline the front-end development process, enhancing efficiency and maintainability.</li>
      </ul>
       <p>By mastering these languages and frameworks, front-end developers craft visually stunning and interactive user interfaces that prioritize user experience.</p>
      </p>

  <section class="section" id="backend">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Backend Development</h2>
      <p>Explore backend technologies such as Node.js, Python, and PHP, and learn about databases and server-side scripting.</p>
      <p>
        The back-end, also known as the server-side, acts as the brain of a website, handling data processing and server communication. Here are some of the core technologies that power the back-end:
      <ul>
        <li>Server-Side Programming Languages (e.g., Python, Java, PHP, Node.js): Process user requests, interact with databases, and generate dynamic web page content.</li>
        <li>Databases: Store website data, enabling features like user accounts, product listings, and content management systems (CMS).</li>
        <li>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Act as intermediaries, allowing communication between different applications and data sources, facilitating the seamless integration of external services.</li>
      </ul>
       <p></p>Back-end developers ensure the website functions flawlessly, manages data securely, and interacts seamlessly with external systems, ensuring a smooth user experience on the front-end.</p>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>Discover essential tools and software for web design and development, including text editors, version control systems, and development environments.</p>
      <p>
        Modern web development leverages a robust set of tools to streamline the process, enhance collaboration, and ensure quality. Here are some of the most popular tools:
      <ul>
        <li>Code Editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging features, making coding more efficient and error-free. (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)</li>
        <li>Version Control Systems (e.g., Git): Track changes made to code over time, facilitating collaboration and allowing developers to revert to previous versions if necessary.</li>
        <li>Project Management Tools (e.g., Trello, Jira): Organize tasks, track project progress, and facilitate communication within development teams, ensuring efficient project delivery.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>By effectively utilizing these tools, developers can work more productively, collaborate seamlessly, and deliver exceptional web experiences that meet user needs and business objectives.</p>
